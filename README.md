# Aptos-Move-Bootcamp-Exercises
I have created this repository to document my learning progress in the Aptos Move bootcamp hosted by Encode Club, Q3 2024.

In the repository, I created folders for each lesson's homework given by the instructor, Mr Laurence Kirk.

Each exercice folder is serially numbered starting from Exercise 1 to <tbd> Below is a list of each exercise folder and content names based on the title of the topic learnt.
