# Exercise 3

### 1. Use the block explorers to find out the number of validators on the Aptos mainnets.
### 2. Do you consider the network decentralised in terms of an individual's voting power, and also the geographical concentration ?
### 3. Try creating the hello-blockchain project in Remix IDE, compile, and prove it. You will need to set up the Welldone browser wallet ,and create and fund an account on devnet.

### 4. Send some devnet APT to your colleagues and find the transactions in the block explorer.


## ANSWERS

1. There are currently **145** active validators on the Aptos mainnet

2. **Voting Power:** The degree of decentralization in voting power on the Aptos network largely depends on token distribution and the effectiveness of the delegation process. 
    If token ownership and delegation are widely distributed, the network can maintain a high level of decentralization. 
    However, if a few entities hold significant token amounts, this could centralize voting power. I believe that At the moment, the Aptos network is reasonably decentralised in terms of voting power.

   **geographical concentration:** Operational decentralization of Proof-of-Stake networks can be evaluated by the distribution of validators and stake across geographic jurisdictions.
   As at June 2023, Aptos had 51% of its Validators situated in Europe, 18.5% in North America and 26% in Asia. I believe Aptos to be decently decentralized in this regard.
