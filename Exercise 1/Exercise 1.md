## SECTION ONE
Imagine you are building a decentralised game
  1. Name some issues arising from decentralisation?
  2. What benefits does decentralisation bring to the game?


## SECTION TWO
Of the following properties that a blockchain can have, which 2 are most important to you ?

  1. High throughput
  2. Low transaction fees
  3. Security
  4. Finality
  5. Governance


# ANSWERS

## SECTION ONE
1. a. **Scalability**: Handling a large number of transactions in real time can be difficult, leading to delays and increased costs.

   b. **Complexity**: Developing a decentralised game is more complex than a traditional one. It involves having in-depth knowledge on blockcahin technology, smart contracts, and the decentralized infrastructure.

   c. **Cost of Transactions**: Many decentralized platforms require users to pay transaction fees (e.g., gas fees on Ethereum). This can impact the user experience and make the game less accessible.


## SECTION TWO
  **Security**: Since blockchains typically handle financial transactions, there is no room for error regarding the security of users' funds.
  **Low transaction fees**: A high transaction cost will deter users from making regular use of a blockchain. They would likely opt for a cheaper option.
